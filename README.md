## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sentiment_insights'
```

Then install:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it directly:

```bash
gem install sentiment_insights
```

---

## Configuration

Configure the provider and (if using OpenAI or AWS) your API key:

```ruby
require 'sentiment_insights'

# For OpenAI
SentimentInsights.configure do |config|
  config.provider = :openai
  config.openai_api_key = ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
end

# For AWS
SentimentInsights.configure do |config|
  config.provider = :aws
  config.aws_region = 'us-east-1'
end

# For sentimental
SentimentInsights.configure do |config|
  config.provider = :sentimental
end
```

Supported providers:
- `:openai`
- `:aws`
- `:sentimental` (local fallback, limited feature set)

---

## Usage

Data entries should be hashes with at least an `:answer` key. Optionally include segmentation info under `:segment`.

```ruby
entries = [
  { answer: "Amazon Checkout was smooth!", segment: { age_group: "18-25", gender: "Female" } },
  { answer: "Walmart Shipping was delayed.", segment: { age_group: "18-25", gender: "Female" } },
  { answer: "Target Support was decent.", segment: { age_group: "26-35", gender: "Male" } },
  { answer: "Loved the product!", segment: { age_group: "18-25", gender: "Male" } }
]
```
